# PMBO
Polymer Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization (PMBO) assiciated by physical descriptors
## Description
Polymer Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization (PMBO)  framework for exploring multifunctional polymers, including four components: 1) Polymer Library, which stores all polymer candidates; 2) Feature extraction, which based on physical feature engineering or graph descriptors generation; 3) Polymer properties simulator, which calculates polymer properties at different scales using DFT, MD and ML. 4) Multi-objective Bayesian algorithm, which predicts polymer properties and recommends potentially multifunctional polymers.Please refer to our work "Discovery of Multifunctional Polymers in Constrained Chemical Space Via Physical Descriptors-Guided Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization" for additional details.
